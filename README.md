Project description:
"It's time to test your design and programming skills by extending the SimpleDrawingPlayer application.  Right now, the application can only draw rectangles that make a certain sound.  Your task is simple: Add an additional tool (and all its underlying functionality) to make an Oval tool that plays a different sound!"
